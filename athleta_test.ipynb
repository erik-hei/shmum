I love that there are no seams on the outer sides of my legs (only on the inseam). They are beyond soft, thick enough that you can’t see thinner underwear, yet not hot when wearing for yoga. The 7/8 length hits me right below the ankle, which I love. I now have 2 pairs and plan to own more in the future. Worth the cost. I have black and black olive (which can read almost dark gray/olive - great neutral color!).\n",

Well done!\n",

I have worn so many different brands, and I have finally found a brand that fits perfectly, ( I am 5'2\"tall, 110lbs)  These tights are so soft and comfortable, and don't get saggy after washing. The quality is excellent, and they are so flattering!!  Also, I love the black/olive color.. they go with everything!  I am now a fan for life!\n",

I love the 7/8 cut so I don’t have to hem which I typically would. Petite fits are just to small for me so I greatly appreciate this length. I’ll be buying my 3rd pair soon. Please do not stop make this tight!!!!\n",

They stay put during class, are super flattering, and are incredibly soft and comfortable - and I am not the kind of girl who feels comfortable wearing yoga pants.

After her first, she wanted a second, and then a third...I think her wardrobe revolves around what goes best with these tights. I recently purchased a pair for myself. I agree! They have a nice waist height, tight, yet comfortable, and the material is excellent quality. She is 5'2 and 110, and prefers the XXS. I'm 5\"4 and 115, and prefer the XS.  We highly recommend this product. I have them in black, and she has black and a rust color.\n",

      "I am 5'2 and 105 lbs and I bought an XXS in black. I sometimes wear an XS at Athleta, but they recommended I size down for this particular pant. I'm glad I did because they fit perfectly. Very flattering, buttery soft, and the waist doesn't slide down. Because I'm petite, they are the perfect \"full-length\" legging on me and hit right above the ankle.The waistband \"holds me in\" so I feel extra confident a few months post-baby but it doesn't compress so much that I'm uncomfortable after a meal or when sitting. While they're great for a work out, they're also simple and casual enough (not a shiny-sporty fabric) so they look great with a tunic tee/sweater. They keep me comfortable while I'm chasing around my toddler all day and I love that I can slip in and out of workouts at any given moment (hello nap time yoga or a spontaneous jog to the park!)\n",
